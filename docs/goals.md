# Project goals

Hero Admin exists because the WordPress admin buries everyday work under twenty years of
accumulated chrome. These are the principles that decide what gets built and how.
The measurable outcomes these principles serve — and the numbers that judge them —
live in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

## Goals

1. **Get out of the way.** The daily work — writing, moderating, checking on the site, managing
   files and users — should be one click away and visually calm. Density serves the reader, not
   the toolbar.
2. **Real replacement, not a demo.** Hero must hold up on real sites with hundreds of thousands
   of rows (it's developed against a production-scale dataset). Pagination, `_fields` allowlists
   and capability gating are non-negotiable, not optimizations.
3. **Zero lock-in.** Everything Hero writes is native WordPress: Gutenberg block markup, core
   options, core REST calls. Deactivate the plugin and nothing is lost or broken. Classic
   wp-admin remains fully available at all times — Hero is additive.
4. **No build step.** One vanilla-JS file, one stylesheet, PHP that reads top to bottom. Anyone
   can read the whole codebase in an afternoon. Frameworks are a dependency treadmill this
   project deliberately stays off.
5. **Defensive by architecture.** Never run other plugins' render paths in list contexts (a
   misbehaving plugin must not be able to take Hero down), never unserialize foreign blobs,
   check capabilities server-side, escape everything at the edge.
6. **An ecosystem invitation.** Third-party plugins integrate through one declarative filter —
   see `for-plugin-authors.md`. Hero ships adapters for popular plugins; plugin authors can ship
   their own without writing JavaScript.
7. **The user outranks every integration.** Nothing a plugin registers may grab attention the
   user did not ask for, and anything a plugin registers can be hidden or muted by the user.
   WordPress lost this fight in its notification system; Hero enforces it with architecture
   (descriptors only, extraction not hosting), budgets and per-user controls — never with
   trust in plugin authors' restraint. See `v1-readiness.md`.

## Non-goals

- **Gutenberg parity.** Complex block layouts belong in the block editor; Hero links to it
  cleanly (`editor-direction.md`).
- **Settings-page parity.** Hero surfaces the settings people actually change. The long tail
  stays in wp-admin.
- **Network Admin parity.** Hero covers daily multisite operations. Network account
  creation and deletion, the long settings tail, restores, exports and network setup stay
  in WordPress Network Admin.
- **Being a page builder.**

## Quality bar

Every feature lands with: browser-level verification on a clean site *and* a production-scale
site, zero console errors, capability checks proven by the UI hiding/showing correctly, and an
Emoji-Log commit. If a feature can't be verified end-to-end, it isn't done.
