# Core coverage audit — gaps vs classic wp-admin

Audited 2026-07-10 against v0.10.0; stale-checked 2026-07-12 during the
v0.13.0 cycle (WP 7.0.1); re-checked 2026-07-13 at v0.14.0 open; light
re-check 2026-07-15 at v0.16.0 open; re-checked 2026-07-23 at v0.21.0 open
(comment editing + commenter blocking, site logo and site language all
shipped in the v0.20.0 cycle; sections below updated); re-checked
2026-07-24 at v0.22.0 open (the read-only database viewer shipped as a
native developer surface, covered under Tools below; no new daily-work
gaps): every
ranked priority remains shipped, no new daily-work gaps in core areas.
Re-audited 2026-07-30 at v0.23.0 open with a theme-integration focus (see
the new section below): the remaining wp-admin territory is theme-shaped
(block-theme Site Editor artifacts, builder theme templates) plus four
smaller operational gaps (per-extension auto-update toggles, theme live
preview, bulk category/author edit, synced-pattern visibility). Dev tools Wave A is complete
(Diagnostics family); further inventory work is adapter depth or parked
native surfaces (`plugin-support.md`, `native-editors.md`). Re-checked
2026-08-06 at v0.24.0 open (unreleased): three of those four smaller gaps
shipped in the v0.23.0 cycle (auto-update toggles, theme live preview,
synced patterns; marked below), and the Media section's folders verdict
was stale: the browse-first provider contract (Wave D) had already
shipped in the v0.18.0 cycle, corrected below. The v0.24.0 cycle so far
is adapter depth (WPForms entries, forms status cards, FluentSMTP) and
changes no core-gap status. Re-checked 2026-08-11 at v0.28.0 open:
multisite moved from defensive degradation to daily network operations;
the section below now records the shipped surface and its deliberate
boundaries. Still open: block-theme surfaces, builder
theme templates, bulk category/author edit. Hero's
positioning grades these: daily work belongs in Hero, the long tail stays
one click away in wp-admin. Each area below gets a status and a judgment on
whether the gap blocks daily work.

## Priority ranking (the gaps that matter)

1. **Term management** — ✅ shipped 2026-07-10: the **Terms** manager
   (Manage → Terms, `/hero-admin/terms`) covers every REST-enabled taxonomy
   with a switcher, an indented tree for hierarchical taxonomies, inline
   create/edit (name, slug, parent, description), delete with honest
   confirms, count links into the filtered content list, and **merge**
   (posts move to the surviving term through core's own reassignment
   machinery, then the source is deleted). Editors get it via
   `manage_categories`; per-taxonomy capabilities are enforced by core's
   REST routes.
2. **Media caption and description** — ✅ shipped (v0.11.0 cycle): the media
   detail modal now edits caption and description alongside title and alt,
   carrying the edit-context raw value (fetched lazily so the list stays
   light) and saving through wp/v2/media.
3. **Media bulk select/delete** — ✅ shipped (v0.11.0 cycle): grid tiles and
   list rows carry a checkbox (shift-range, select-all) with a delete bar
   mirroring the content-list pattern; force=true, per item.
4. **Comment bulk moderation** — ✅ shipped (v0.11.0 cycle): comment rows get
   a checkbox + Select-page, and a bar whose verbs are the current tab's own
   actions (Approve/Spam/Trash on Pending, Restore/Delete on Trash, and so
   on), applied per item.
5. **Bulk user role change** — ✅ shipped (v0.11.0 cycle): the users table
   gains a checkbox column (gated on edit-users) and a bar to change every
   selected user's role at once; the current user is skipped (self-lockout
   guard).
6. **Per-post format picker** — ✅ shipped (v0.11.0 cycle): the editor sidebar
   has a Format select, gated on the active theme declaring post-format
   support (matching wp-admin), saving through wp/v2's native `format`
   field. Boot payload carries the supported formats.

## Area-by-area status

### Customizer and theme options — partial, mostly by design
Covered: site identity lives in Settings → General (title, tagline, site icon
with full upload flow, site address, admin email); homepage settings in
Settings → Reading (latest posts vs static page, with page pickers); and as of
the v0.11.0 cycle, **Custom CSS** (`wp_custom_css_post`, the Customizer's
"Additional CSS") edits in Settings → Design through
`hero-admin/v1/custom-css` (edit_css cap, per-theme stylesheet, structural
validation mirroring the Customizer's refusal). Custom logo and site
language shipped in the v0.20.0 cycle (Settings → Site: the logo gated on
theme custom-logo support via `hero-admin/v1/site-logo`, the language over
`hero-admin/v1/site/language`, downloading packs on save). Missing: other
theme mods, FSE global styles. Judgment: identity + homepage + Custom CSS +
logo + language is the daily slice and it's covered; the Customizer proper
and global styles are correctly long-tail.

### Appearance — covered where it counts
Menus (with drag reorder) and classic widgets are fully built; themes
install/activate/update/delete under Extensions. Template/FSE editing,
background and header images: out of scope by design.

### Theme integration — the audited frontier (2026-07-30)
On a CLASSIC theme, the daily slice is covered: Menus, Widgets, logo, icon,
Custom CSS, homepage. The gaps cluster on block themes and theme builders,
verified empirically at v0.23.0:

1. **Block themes lose ground with no replacement (L, needs design).**
   Hero correctly hides Menus and Widgets when `wp_is_block_theme()`
   (`B.site.blockTheme`), but nothing steps in: no navigation editing
   (`wp_navigation` posts have REST parity with what the Menus manager
   already does for classic menus), no template/template-part LISTING with
   Site Editor deep links, no global-styles summary. A block-theme site
   demotes Hero from "the admin" to "the content admin". Scoped build,
   ranked inside this item: navigation first (real daily work, existing
   Menus UX transfers), then a read-only Design card (active theme, its
   templates/parts as "Edit in Site Editor ↗" rows, current palette). The
   Site Editor canvas itself is a permanent link-out (same reasoning as
   form builders).
2. **Builder theme templates are invisible (M).** `elementor_library` IS
   REST-exposed but not `viewable`, so the content switcher (rightly)
   skips it, meaning a site whose header/footer live in Elementor Theme
   Builder has no Hero surface listing those templates. Same story for
   Bricks/Divi template areas. Fits the existing page-builders adapter
   thesis: list, badge the type (header/footer/popup/archive), show
   display conditions read-only, deep-link into the builder canvas.
3. ~~**Per-extension auto-update toggles (S).**~~ **SHIPPED 2026-08-04**
   (v0.23.0 cycle): Auto pills on plugin AND theme cards through
   `hero-admin/v1/auto-updates` (the same option writes as
   `wp_ajax_toggle_auto_updates`, stale entries pruned; gated on
   `wp_is_auto_update_enabled_for_type` server- and client-side). Suite
   `tests/auto-updates.test.js`.
4. ~~**Theme live preview (S).**~~ **SHIPPED 2026-08-04** (v0.23.0
   cycle): Live preview link on inactive theme cards: Customizer for
   classic themes, `site-editor.php?wp_theme_preview=` for block themes
   (the `block` flag now rides `hero-admin/v1/themes`).
5. **Bulk edit beyond status (M).** The content bulk bar does status /
   trash / restore / delete but not wp-admin bulk-edit's "add these
   categories / set author across selected posts".
6. ~~**Synced patterns (S-M).**~~ **SHIPPED 2026-08-04** (v0.23.0 cycle):
   wp_block allowlisted past the viewable gate (`slimContentTypes`) → a
   Patterns entry in the Content switcher with the standard row machinery
   (front-end view/preview suppressed, not publicly queryable); slash
   menu + ⌘/ picker "Your patterns" (synced → `wp:block {"ref":N}`
   reference island, quiet insert; unsynced → detached copy via
   `insertPatternIslands`); editor opens `/editor/blocks/{id}` natively
   with a synced-edit note and self-slimmed sidebar; + New → Pattern.
   GOTCHA: `wp_pattern_sync_status` is top-level READ-only in REST;
   writes ride `meta.wp_pattern_sync_status`. Suite
   `tests/user-patterns.test.js`.
7. **Classic Customizer theme options — stays a link-out.** Arbitrary
   theme mods (colors, header/background images, per-theme sections) are
   a per-theme treadmill with no schema; the Customizer deep link is the
   honest answer, same verdict as before.

### Taxonomies — covered
The Terms manager shipped 2026-07-10 (see priority #1). The only server
addition was `hero-admin/v1/terms/merge`; everything else rides core REST.
As of the v0.11.0 cycle, Terms is folded into the **Structure** page (Post
Types / Taxonomies / Terms tabs) rather than a standalone nav item, to keep
the MANAGE group short. The tabs gate individually: Post Types and
Taxonomies need `manage_options`, Terms needs only `manage_categories`, so
an editor's Structure item shows just the Terms tab (labeled "Terms" for
them), while an admin sees all three. The `/hero-admin/terms` route and the
⌘K "Manage categories & tags" command still work, landing on the Terms tab.

### Tools — System page strong, one-shot tools absent
The System page covers diagnostics well (health checks, DB tables, autoload
weight, cron health, debug toggles + log viewer, integrations registry,
extensions manifest, copy-as-markdown report). Loopback and REST self-check
health rows shipped 2026-07-10 (core's own Site Health tests, cached 15
minutes), and a Tools card deep-links the one-shot jobs (Site Health,
export/import, GDPR export/erase): episodic surgery stays in wp-admin, one
click away, by design. As of the v0.22.0 cycle the Database card is also a
doorway: its largest-table rows and a "browse all" link open the read-only
database viewer (`/hero-admin/database`, also in ⌘K; deliberately not a nav
item). Writes and a SQL console stay permanent non-goals there
(`native-editors.md`).

### Settings — daily options covered, two screens thin
Writable today: General (title, tagline, icon, URL, admin email, timezone,
date/time format, week start, default role, membership, maintenance, default
admin), Writing (default category/format, smilies), Reading (front page,
posts per page, search visibility), Discussion (default comment/ping status,
moderation, registration required, avatars on/off), Permalinks (structure +
bases), Spam (provider cards + disallowed keys), Connectors (WP 7.0's
connector registry: provider keys with core-side masking and validation,
key-source honesty for wp-config/env keys, companion-plugin install in
place), plus site logo and site language on the Site tab since the v0.20.0
cycle. Missing: the entire Media
settings screen (thumbnail sizes, month/year folders),
`posts_per_rss` / feed excerpt, and most of the Discussion matrix (threading
depth, per-page, previously-approved shortcut, close-after-days, notification
emails, avatar rating/default). Judgment: what's missing is set-once config;
add Discussion depth only if comment-heavy sites ask.

### Users — at parity or better
List, search, roles, add/edit, delete with content reassignment, password
reset, send email, session kill, bulk role change (shipped v0.11.0),
application passwords ("AI Access" with generated agent guide). The
long-tail profile fields all shipped v0.17.0 on the /hero-admin/profile
page (first/last name, bio, website, per-user language with automatic
pack installs, the front-end toolbar preference). Application passwords
and reassign-on-delete are better surfaced than classic.

### Media — grid solid, editing caught up
Grid with type filter/search/pagination, multi-upload, drag-drop, image
editor (rotate/crop to a new copy), featured-image flows, delete, copy URL,
caption/description editing and bulk delete (both shipped v0.11.0).
Unattached filter (core parent=0), month filter (hero-admin/v1/media/months
combobox → after/before windows) and the detail modal's "Attached to" row
with an editor jump all shipped 2026-07-17 (v0.18.0 cycle, suite
media-polish). Folders: not a
core feature (a Hero-owned tree would be a fifth folder standard invisible
to wp-admin and builder pickers), but the earlier "long-tail, skip" verdict
was revised 2026-07-16: FileBird + Real Media Library + Folders total 400k+
installs, so a browse-first provider contract became Wave D in
`docs/plugin-support.md`. Wave D shipped 2026-07-17 (v0.18.0 cycle): the
`hero_admin_media_folders` provider filter
(`includes/adapters/media-folders.php`) with bundled FileBird, Real Media
Library and Folders by Premio providers; a folder picker on the Media view
filters the normal wp/v2/media query (search, type tabs, Unattached and
pagination keep working, newest 500 per folder), and a Move-to-folder bulk
action rides each provider's optional `move` callable. Suite
`tests/media-folders.test.js`. Moving stays browse-first: Hero never owns
a folder tree of its own.

### Comments — complete, single-row and bulk
Tabs for pending/approved/spam/trash, full per-row moderation, bulk
moderation with per-tab verbs (shipped v0.11.0), inline reply
(auto-approves like core), context menu. The last two gaps closed in the
v0.20.0 cycle: inline comment editing (text always; author name/email for
guest comments) and Block commenter (adds the author's email or IP to
core's disallowed list, visible under Settings → Comments, with Undo).

### Multisite — daily network operations covered
Hero boots on main sites and subsites, heals routes after network activation,
and offers a capped, searchable site switcher in the sidebar and command
palette. A subsite administrator gets the site's full Users list with role
changes, add-existing-account and remove-membership actions; network
administrators are protected from those per-site controls.

Network administrators get first-class Sites, Network users and Network
settings surfaces. The daily slice covers site creation and lifecycle,
network-administrator promotion and revocation, registration, uploads, site
administrator permissions and network mail. Extensions adds network-wide
plugin activation and theme availability, and a core update runs the required
database migration across each subsite.

The boundary is deliberate: network account creation/deletion, welcome
emails, first-post text, reserved names, language defaults, restores, exports
and network setup stay in WordPress Network Admin. Very large networks use
WordPress's Upgrade Network screen rather than a request-bound site walk.
Network-shared logs, database tables and plugin data are either scoped by site
or restricted to super administrators; a per-site `manage_options` check is
never treated as permission to read the whole network.

### Structural observation — REST-only is a hard boundary
Anything not exposed to REST is invisible to Hero by construction: CPTs and
taxonomies without `show_in_rest` (the UI flags them), meta not registered,
custom statuses. This is deliberate and worth keeping; it's the line that
keeps list views fast and safe.
