# Block inspector — editing complex blocks without Gutenberg

**Status: all five steps shipped (v0.4.0 cycle) — code language attribute (plus a hover/caret
⚙ chip popout on editable code blocks), the inspector for attribute/dynamic islands with
server-rendered previews (`hero-admin/v1/render-blocks` replaced the per-block
`block-renderer` idea — it renders whole islands including static parents with dynamic
children), one-level child editing, add/remove/reorder children (gated on the "structural"
InnerBlocks shape: wrapper HTML preserved verbatim, whitespace-only between children), and
the `hero_admin_block_forms` filter with `wrapperText` — which delivered the useful subset of
"parent editing": declared text inside a wrapper (e.g. the conversation header) is editable
via a three-capture-group pattern, replaced only when changed. Adapters ship inside the
integrated plugin (Anchor Blocks `app/HeroAdmin.php` is the reference), not bundled in Hero.
Full parent-attribute regeneration for static InnerBlocks wrappers remains deliberately
unbuilt — it requires the block's JS `save()` and stays on the wrong side of the parity
treadmill.**

**Two later additions (v0.5.x cycle):** the inspector on a `core/embed` / `core/gallery`
island offers **"Change URL…" / "Replace images…"** — these regenerate the island wholesale
through the same templates that create embeds and galleries (`embedTemplate()` /
`galleryTemplate()`), because their content lives in saved HTML where attribute edits alone
can't retarget it. Gutenberg-set captions/layout attributes reset by design; the popover
note says so. And island previews now render with the site's **real front-end styles** —
`hero-admin/v1/editor-styles` collects block style handles + theme editor styles + the
global stylesheet, and the client scopes every rule to `.hero-island-preview` before
injecting (see editor-direction.md, "The writing surface").

**Post-v0.8.0 addition (auto-registered inserts):** dynamic third-party blocks no longer
need an adapter to be insertable. `Hero_Admin::insertable_blocks()` walks the block-type
registry at boot (dynamic + top-level + inserter-visible + non-core; adapter `insert`
descriptors supersede, `insert => false` suppresses, `hero_admin_insert_blocks` filters the
result) and the slash menu carries them as **search-only** entries: the default list stays
curated, and typing matches title or namespace. A self-closing comment is valid saved
markup only when the block's JS `save()` is null — `is_dynamic` is NOT that guarantee
(stackable/posts pairs a render_callback with a JS save that emits wrapper HTML; a bare
comment renders empty AND fails Gutenberg validation). The server can't see JS `save()`, so
the shipped discriminator is a **render probe**: candidates whose bare comment renders
nothing are excluded (cached in a transient keyed on the candidate set). Static-save blocks
remain excluded per "The honest limit" below — but see `adapters/stackable.php` for the
scrape-the-data counter-move: when a plugin publishes its designs as serialized markup
(Stackable's CDN design library), those templates insert as valid islands with no runtime.

**Generic text runs (same cycle):** the honest limit got narrower. A static block's
STRUCTURE and STYLING still can't be regenerated outside Gutenberg, but its TEXT is just
text nodes in the saved HTML — so the inspector scans an island's raw markup by offset
(`textRunsOf`: block comments, tags and style/script/svg subtrees skipped) and renders one
field per text node, however deep the nesting and even for blocks with no registered
attributes. Changed runs are spliced back last-to-first with text-node escaping only;
untouched runs are never rewritten, preserving byte-identity. Gutenberg stays happy because
these blocks SOURCE their text attributes from that same HTML. Children already served by
the single-element text editor (`childTextOf`) keep it — the two paths are mutually
exclusive per child.

**Image swaps (same cycle):** the sibling move for pictures. Static blocks mirror an
image's URL between comment JSON (`imageUrl`, `blockBackgroundMediaUrl`) and saved HTML
(`img src`, `background-image` style), so `swapIslandImage()` replaces the URL string
everywhere (plus its serializeAttributes-escaped form), retargets paired `XxxUrl`/`XxxId`
media ids scoped to the comment carrying the URL, and updates `wp-image-N` classes on
swapped `img` tags. The inspector's Images section lists every image in the island with a
Replace button into the media picker; pending field edits are folded into the raw first
(`buildInspectorRaw`, shared with Apply) so nothing typed is lost. Embed/gallery keep
their dedicated rebuild flows — the generic swap is suppressed there, since core image
comments carry a bare `id` the URL-key heuristic can't safely retarget.

Block islands made complex content *safe* (see [editor-direction.md](editor-direction.md)) —
this is the plan for making them *workable*. The goal: click an island, get a small inspector
popover next to it, edit the block's configuration in place, watch the preview update. No React,
no build step, no change to the safety model.

## Why this is feasible at all

The key realization: for **server-registered blocks**, everything the inspector needs already
exists as core REST endpoints — Hero drives the same server-side machinery Gutenberg does,
minus the React shell.

| Need | Endpoint | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| What attributes does this block have? | `GET wp/v2/block-types/<namespace>/<name>` → full attribute schema with types and defaults | ✓ returns `role` / `label` / `content` for `anchor/conversation-message` |
| What does it look like with these attributes? | `GET wp/v2/block-renderer/<name>?context=edit&attributes={…}` → server-rendered HTML | ✓ renders `anchor/stat-card` with arbitrary attrs |

Self-closing dynamic blocks (`<!-- wp:anchor/stat-card {"value":"85","label":"…"} /-->`) are
**pure attribute containers** — no saved HTML exists to invalidate, so editing them is literally
rewriting JSON inside a comment. The island's raw markup is already stored verbatim and spliced
back on save; the inspector just modifies that stored string. Nothing about the byte-identity
model changes.

## The design

1. **Trigger** — a ⚙ affordance on the island chip (and clicking the chip itself). Opens a
   popover anchored to the island, same visual family as the slash-command menu.
2. **Schema-driven form** — fetch the block type once (cache per session), generate fields from
   the attribute schema: `string` → input, `boolean` → switch, `number` → number input,
   `enum` → select. Skip `lock` / `metadata` / `style` (Gutenberg plumbing).
3. **Apply** — rewrite the attributes JSON in the island's stored raw markup: for self-closing
   blocks, rebuild the whole comment; for wrapped dynamic blocks, rebuild only the opening
   comment and keep inner HTML untouched.
4. **Preview refresh** — POST the new attrs to `block-renderer` and swap the island preview.
   Blocks with no `render_callback` keep their static preview.
5. **Serialize** — unchanged. Islands still pass through verbatim from stored raw markup.

### Nested islands (`anchor/conversation`)

The conversation block is a static InnerBlocks wrapper whose children are self-closing dynamic
`conversation-message` blocks. `tokenizeBlocks()` already splits nested content, so the
inspector can list children and edit each one with the same schema-driven form — including
add / remove / reorder, since children are attribute-only comments. The parent's own wrapper
markup (`<div class="wp-block-anchor-conversation"><div class="ab-conv-header">…</div>`) is
reproducible but is saved by the block's JS `save()`, so regenerating it risks Gutenberg's
block validation — **ship child editing first, parent-attribute editing last, behind
round-trip tests.**

### The code block (ships first, independent of the inspector)

`<!-- wp:code {"language":"sql"} -->` islands today only because `language` isn't in
`EDITABLE_ATTRS`. Add `code: [ 'language' ]`, map the attribute into the existing toolbar
language picker on load, re-emit attribute + `language-*` class on serialize. The block becomes
fully editable and the picker (built in v0.2.0) just works. Small, high value — the most common
island on real content.

## The honest limit

**Static third-party blocks** — ones whose `save()` lives in their editor JS bundle — stay
verbatim islands. Changing their attributes requires regenerating HTML only Gutenberg's runtime
can produce; that's the parity treadmill editor-direction.md refuses to get on. They already
display and survive edits safely, and WordPress has pushed block development server-side for
years, so the reachable set keeps growing on its own.

Authors who want first-class Hero editing should follow the **content-block contract** in
[content-blocks.md](content-blocks.md) (dynamic leaves, PHP schema, optional
`hero_admin_block_forms`). That is how Anchor Blocks stay editable in Hero without Hero
becoming a layout runtime.

## Extension point

Schema types alone can't express intent: `role` is really a user/assistant enum, `content`
deserves a textarea, `color` is a fixed palette. A `hero_admin_block_forms` filter (same
declarative-descriptor pattern as surfaces and editor panels — see
[for-plugin-authors.md](for-plugin-authors.md)) lets a plugin refine the generated form for its
own blocks: labels, control types, option lists, field order. Anchor Blocks becomes the
reference adapter, the same role ACF plays for editor panels.

## Sequencing

1. `code.language` via `EDITABLE_ATTRS` — small.
2. Inspector for attribute-only / dynamic islands (stat-card, callout, timeline-item…) — the
   core build: schema fetch, form generation, comment rewrite, renderer preview.
3. Child-block editing inside InnerBlocks islands (conversation messages).
4. `hero_admin_block_forms` filter + Anchor Blocks descriptors.
5. (Maybe, last) parent-attribute editing for simple InnerBlocks wrappers, gated on proven
   round-trips.
