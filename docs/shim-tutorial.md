# The shim tutorial — a custom-table plugin, wired into Hero

Most plugins that would benefit from a Hero surface keep their data in a
custom database table: form entries, email logs, redirects, queue rows. Core
REST knows nothing about those tables, so the integration is two parts:

1. **a REST shim** — a few small routes that translate "rows in my table"
   into JSON, and
2. **a surface descriptor** — pure data telling Hero how to render it.

This walkthrough builds both for a fictional plugin, start to finish. The
finished code is a real, working plugin you can copy:
[`docs/examples/hero-example-adapter/`](examples/hero-example-adapter/hero-example-adapter.php).
Drop it into `wp-content/plugins/`, activate it next to Hero Admin, and a
**Feedback** view appears in the sidebar with a status card, tabs, search, a
detail modal and row actions. Every section below is numbered to match the
comments in that file. (It is also exercised by Hero's own test suite,
`tests/example-adapter.test.js`, so if the contract ever changes, the
example breaks in CI before it breaks under you.)

The fiction: **Campfire** collects visitor feedback into
`{prefix}campfire_feedback`: id, name, email, message, a status
(`new` / `read` / `archived`), and a UTC `created_at`.

## Step 0 — where the code lives

One file inside your own plugin, loaded unconditionally:

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/includes/hero-admin.php';
```

Everything in it is `add_filter` / `register_rest_route` calls: with Hero
absent the filter never fires and the routes just sit there: a free no-op.
No `class_exists( 'Hero_Admin' )` guard needed. (The example plugin is
single-file only because it's a tutorial.)

## Step 1 — the data (one decision that matters)

The table itself is whatever your plugin already has. The one choice worth
making deliberately: **store timestamps in UTC** (`gmdate`, not
`current_time`). Hero renders relative times ("2 hours ago") in the
visitor's timezone, and it needs to know what it's parsing. Bare datetimes
are assumed site-local; a `utc: true` flag on the column (step 4) declares
otherwise. The classic shim bug is storing UTC and letting it render as
site-local: every timestamp shifts by the site's offset and nobody notices
until a log entry appears to come from the future.

## Step 2 — one capability helper

```php
function campfire_can() {
	return current_user_can( 'moderate_comments' );
}
```

Pick the capability for the **data**, not for the screen. These rows hold
visitor names, email addresses and message bodies, so the bar is the one you
would set for reading comments. `edit_posts` would have handed the whole
inbox to every Contributor. A surface is only ever as private as its
capability, and the default in an example is what gets copied.

Hero checks the descriptor's `cap` before the surface exists in the app at
all, but that is UI gating, a convenience. **Your routes' own
`permission_callback` is the boundary.** Centralize the answer in one
function so the two can never disagree, and swap the body for your plugin's
real capability model (a granular cap, an option-driven role check, your
own resolver). If your plugin has its own access settings ("only these
roles may see submissions"), route through them here, the way the bundled
WP Activity Log adapter routes through that plugin's own
`Settings_Helper::current_user_can()`.

## Step 3 — the REST shim

Five small routes. The shapes Hero consumes:

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /feedback` | `{ "items": [...], "total": 123 }` — the list |
| `GET /feedback/{id}` | one item — the detail modal |
| `POST /feedback/{id}/read` | `{ "message": "Marked as read" }` — an action |
| `POST /feedback/{id}/archive` | same shape — a second action |
| `GET /feedback/status` | the status card model |

Rules that keep a shim safe, all visible in the example file:

- **Every route declares `permission_callback`.** Never `__return_true` for
  private data. (Hero's System page flags plugins that skip this.)
- **Every query goes through `$wpdb->prepare`.** The search input is a
  visitor-typed string headed into SQL: `esc_like` + placeholders, no
  exceptions.
- **Cap `per_page`.** Hero asks for 25; a hand-crafted request should not be
  able to ask for a million.
- **Never `unserialize()` stored blobs.** Not needed for Campfire, but the
  rule that bites real log tables: if an old row holds a PHP-serialized
  value, parse it with a regex or `json_decode`; a crafted blob must never
  reach `unserialize()`.

The list route reads three inputs Hero sends: `page` (plus whatever your
`pageQuery` template names, here `per_page`), the active tab's value (here
the `status` param, declared in step 4), and the debounced `search` term.
It answers `{ items, total }`; the descriptor's `itemsKey` / `totalKey`
point Hero at both. Standard WP-style collections (plain array +
`X-WP-Total` header) skip those two keys entirely.

Shape each row in one function (`campfire_item()` in the example) so the
list and detail routes can never drift apart.

Action routes do their one write through your plugin's own code path and
may return `{ "message": "…" }`; that string replaces Hero's default
"⟨label⟩ — done" toast, which is the honest channel when the outcome needs
more words than the button label promised.

The status route returns **display-ready strings**: Hero renders the card,
your server does the formatting (counts, `human_time_diff`, currency,
whatever). An optional `chart` key draws a daily bar series in the same
visual language as Hero's Overview charts.

## Step 4 — the descriptor

Pure data on one filter. No callbacks reach the client (`setup` callables
are evaluated server-side), no JavaScript ships, and Hero escapes every
value it renders; never pre-escape.

```php
add_filter( 'hero_admin_surfaces', 'campfire_surface' );
```

Walking the choices in the example's descriptor:

- **`cap`** — mirrors `campfire_can()` (step 2).
- **`group: 'workspace'`** — Campfire is inbox-shaped: new items arrive and
  need a human. That is the bar for Workspace placement. Logs, redirects
  and plumbing belong in the default Tools group; users can hide any
  surface they disagree with (and there is no API to resist it).
- **`tabs`** — the static form: a `param` plus `[value, label]` pairs. Hero
  appends `status=new` to the list request for the New tab and omits the
  param for All. (The `{tab}`-in-route form exists for APIs like Gravity
  Forms whose tab is a path segment.)
- **`search: 'search={q}'`** — a query-string template. The object form of
  `search` is only for APIs that take JSON criteria strings; if your route
  reads a plain param, use the template.
- **`columns`** — note `format: 'pill'` on status and `format: 'ago'` with
  **`utc: true`** on the timestamp (the step-1 decision, declared).
- **`detail`** — `detailRoute` fetches the full item; `messageKey` renders
  one field as the large message block; `skip` hides bookkeeping keys.
  Remaining keys render as rows with snake_case shown as words; name your
  response keys for humans and you need nothing else. (`labels` exists for
  APIs whose keys are numeric field ids and points at a route that resolves
  them; `sectionsRoute` hands Hero a fully server-built view instead.)
- **`actions`** — "Mark read" carries `when: { key: 'status', equals: 'new' }`
  so it is only offered while the item is actually new; "Archive" carries
  `confirm` and `danger`. Both run through the shim routes from step 3 and
  appear in the detail modal and the row's ⋯ / right-click menu.

## Step 5 — verify

1. Activate both plugins. **Feedback** appears in Hero's sidebar under
   Workspace.
2. Open `/hero-admin/system` and find the **Integrations** card: your
   surface is listed, attributed to your plugin, with no flagged problems.
   This card is your build-time debugger: a typo'd descriptor key or a
   missing route explains itself here instead of failing silently.
3. Click through: tabs narrow server-side, search narrows, the detail modal
   shows the message, "Mark read" disappears from an item once used (the
   `when` gate), and the status card counts move.

If the surface doesn't appear at all: the current user fails your `cap`, or
the descriptor didn't register (is your file loaded unconditionally?). If
the list is empty but the surface renders: hit your list route directly
(`/wp-json/campfire/v1/feedback`), logged in; a `permission_callback` typo
answers 401 and Hero shows an empty list rather than someone else's error
page.

The finished surface, all of it declared in step 3:

## Where to go from here

Everything else in [for-plugin-authors.md](for-plugin-authors.md) is
additive on top of this exact shape: bulk actions, a second collection
(`manage`), extra list views (`views`), schema-driven settings, setup
gates, create forms, inline detail editing. The bundled adapters in
`includes/adapters/` are all real-world instances of this tutorial's
pattern against plugins like Gravity SMTP, Duplicator and Limit Login
Attempts. When a shape in the reference reads abstract, one of them is
the concrete version.
